# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Endpoint mode hardening.** `bastion setup` now blanks edge-only configuration
  (relay, WireGuard, gateway, DHCP, DNS upstream) when building an endpoint machine
  config, so endpoint nodes no longer inherit stale edge values from the example skeleton.
- `flowcheck` / `bastion check` is now mode-aware: an endpoint no longer reports false
  failures for edge-only flows (relay handshake, WireGuard server interface, local DNS
  listener, ISP-DNS-leak guard).
- `edge-watchdog` never rolls back on an endpoint: a sustained egress loss on a
  non-routing node is alert-only — it has no edge config to repair, and rolling back
  edge network state could disrupt an ordinary workstation.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-14

First public release.

### Added

- Seven composable layers (L0 core, L1 feeds, L2 crowdsec, L3 ai-analysis, L4 dns-dhcp,
  L5 vpn, L6 monitoring) for both edge and endpoint modes.
- Operator CLI: `setup`, `generate`, `status`, `layer`, `firewall`, `ai`, `check`.
- Intelligent setup wizard with topology detection, profile recommendation, package
  installation, config generation, and post-install verification.
- Provider-agnostic AI analysis backend (Claude / mock / local) that receives only
  sanitized topology signals.
- Reconciler as the sole writer to managed nftables sets, fed by threat feeds and CrowdSec.
- Resilience: standing watchdog with snapshot/rollback, always-installed recovery service,
  WAN-carrier-aware self-heal, and a human kill switch.
- WireGuard / ZeroTier setup with key generation and an optional interface MTU knob.
- DNS sinkhole (ads / trackers / malware) and host-resolver leak detection.
