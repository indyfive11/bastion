## [1.0.3] - 2026-06-15

Endpoint-mode dogfooding pass: a live install on an ordinary laptop surfaced a
cluster of bugs where edge assumptions leaked into endpoint mode, plus a wizard
gap. None affect edge nodes; all were found and fixed against a real endpoint.

### Fixed

- **The AI kill switch was inert on endpoint nodes.** `edge-ctl panic`,
  `edge-ctl ai-disable`, and `edge-ctl rollback` hardcoded the `inet edge` table, so on
  an endpoint (whose table is `inet bastion`) they flushed a table that does not exist
  and **printed success while doing nothing**. `edge-ctl` now reads `NFT_TABLE` from the
  environment / `machine.env`. The human kill switch works in both modes.
- **The firewall did not survive a reboot.** `bastion layer install l0` loaded the
  ruleset with `nft -f` but never enabled `nftables.service`, so the firewall was gone
  after a reboot. L0 install now `systemctl enable --now nftables`; uninstall disables it.
- **`net-snapshot` / `net-rollback` hardcoded `inet edge`** when detecting the
  known-good firewall, the same class of bug as the kill switch. Both now honor
  `NFT_TABLE`.
- **Mode detection misread an endpoint as an edge node.** A Wi-Fi laptop was proposed
  as `edge` and offered an unplugged NIC and an example subnet. Detection now treats a
  Wi-Fi default route as endpoint, requires two **carrier-up** physical NICs for edge,
  and prefers an up, addressed interface for the endpoint LAN.
- **SSH-port detection missed `sshd_config.d/*.conf` drop-ins** during non-root setup,
  so a non-default SSH port could be lost. Detection now reads the drop-in directory.
- **Read-only health checks reported false failures.** nft table/set checks that need
  root now report `[????] needs root to verify` instead of `[FAIL]` when run unprivileged.
- **`flowcheck` mislabeled a loaded firewall as inactive.** `nftables.service` is a
  oneshot unit, so `is-active` reads `inactive` even when the ruleset is loaded.
  `flowcheck` now reports `is-enabled` (the truthful persistence signal).
- **`lan-verify` showed a misleading error on endpoints.** It now reports cleanly that
  LAN-client relay verification is not applicable to a non-routing endpoint.

### Added

- **`bastion setup --set KEY=VALUE`** (repeatable) — set any wizard answer
  non-interactively, so setup is fully scriptable. Previously a piped (non-TTY) run
  silently accepted all detected defaults with no way to override a value such as
  `trusted_hosts`. Unknown keys are rejected.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Refuse to flush an active OS firewall.** bastion's nftables ruleset begins with
  `flush ruleset`, so installing the core firewall (via `bastion setup` or
  `bastion layer install l0`) while **ufw** or **firewalld** was active would have wiped
  that firewall's rules and left the two fighting. Setup and L0 install now detect an
  active ufw/firewalld and abort with instructions to disable it first. Override with
  `BASTION_ALLOW_FIREWALL_TAKEOVER=1` if you really want bastion to take over.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Endpoint mode hardening.** `bastion setup` now blanks edge-only configuration
  (relay, WireGuard, gateway, DHCP, DNS upstream) when building an endpoint machine
  config, so endpoint nodes no longer inherit stale edge values from the example skeleton.
- `flowcheck` / `bastion check` is now mode-aware: an endpoint no longer reports false
  failures for edge-only flows (relay handshake, WireGuard server interface, local DNS
  listener, ISP-DNS-leak guard).
- `edge-watchdog` never rolls back on an endpoint: a sustained egress loss on a
  non-routing node is alert-only — it has no edge config to repair, and rolling back
  edge network state could disrupt an ordinary workstation.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-14

First public release.

### Added

- Seven composable layers (L0 core, L1 feeds, L2 crowdsec, L3 ai-analysis, L4 dns-dhcp,
  L5 vpn, L6 monitoring) for both edge and endpoint modes.
- Operator CLI: `setup`, `generate`, `status`, `layer`, `firewall`, `ai`, `check`.
- Intelligent setup wizard with topology detection, profile recommendation, package
  installation, config generation, and post-install verification.
- Provider-agnostic AI analysis backend (Claude / mock / local) that receives only
  sanitized topology signals.
- Reconciler as the sole writer to managed nftables sets, fed by threat feeds and CrowdSec.
- Resilience: standing watchdog with snapshot/rollback, always-installed recovery service,
  WAN-carrier-aware self-heal, and a human kill switch.
- WireGuard / ZeroTier setup with key generation and an optional interface MTU knob.
- DNS sinkhole (ads / trackers / malware) and host-resolver leak detection.
